## Overview

The goal of this project is to adapt [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) to [yolo](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), get acceptable
quality mask while maintaining high frame rate. This solution is based on
[darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow), it's trained on mscoco and currently we get 88% mask
accuracy on 5K validation set. Frame rate is very high comparing to original mask r-cnn, it's 20+ fps.

## HOWTO train/run, how it works, etc.
